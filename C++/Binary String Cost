/*Q.According to the new tax scheme, a new tax called the binary string tax was introduced! JJ has a binary string SS of length NN. 
According to the tax scheme, for every occurrence of 0101 in SS, a tax of XX rupees will be charged, 
while for every occurrence of 1010 in SS,
a tax of YY rupees will be charged.

//For example, if X = 5X=5, Y = 7Y=7 and S = 11010S=11010, then SS has 11 occurrence of 0101 and 22 occurrences of 1010,
so the tax charged = 5 \cdot 1 + 7 \cdot 2 = 19=5⋅1+7⋅2=19

//JJ can rearrange the string SS in any way he wants. He wants to minimize the amount of tax he has to pay. Can you help him do so?*/
